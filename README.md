# High-Dimensional Statistics — Exercises & Notes (Rigollet, 2023)

Unofficial, work-in-progress solutions, derivations, and small experiments for **Philippe Rigollet’s _High-Dimensional Statistics_ lecture notes** (arXiv: [2310.19244](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19244)).  
The goal is to build clean, reproducible write-ups that clarify intuition, verify results numerically, and serve as a reference for future study.

> **Status:** actively adding chapters; see checklist below.
